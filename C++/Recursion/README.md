# Recusion
## Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
### For example to find factorial of a number we use F(n)=n * F(n-1)
### Thus for F(n-1) = (n-1) * F(n-2) and so on till n becomes zero
### There must be a base condition where recursion is stopped. For factorial it should be like if n==0 it should retrurn( as factorial of whole number is only defined)
#### In such a way there are more such repetitive function and algo which we might use in our program
