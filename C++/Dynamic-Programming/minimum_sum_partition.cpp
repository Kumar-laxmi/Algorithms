=============================Problem Statement=============================
Given an array, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.

If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

Example:

Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5}
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11

============================LOGIC============================
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming when the sum of the elements is not too big. 
We can create a 2D array dp[n+1][(sum/2)+1] where n is number of elements in given set and sum is sum of all elements. 
We can construct the solution in bottom up manner maximizing the sum of a partion having sum less than or equal to (sum/2).

then minimum difference between partion is (sum-2*dp[n][sum/2])
