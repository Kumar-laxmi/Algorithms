#Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm - C++

##Features

Pure C++ implementation without relying on any machine learning libraries.
Provides a basic implementation of the SVM algorithm with a linear kernel.
Demonstrates the usage of classes and functions in C++.
Supports larger datasets compared to the Python implementation due to improved performance.


##Dependencies

C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)


##How to Build and Run

Open the svm_algorithm.cpp file in a C++ IDE or text editor.
Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler.
Run the resulting executable file.
The program will generate a larger dataset and split it into training and testing sets.
It will then train the SVM model using the training set and make predictions on the testing set.
The predicted values for each sample will be displayed in the console.
