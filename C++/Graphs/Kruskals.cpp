/*Kruskals Algorithm
    Author: Phalesh Kolpe
    Kruskals algorithm is used to Find the MST(Minimum Spaning Tree) of a graph it considers the edges and weight of the edge
    Step 1: Sort all edges in increasing order of their edge weights.
    Step 2: Pick the smallest edge.
    Step 3: Check if the new edge creates a cycle or loop in a spanning tree.
    Step 4: If it doesnâ€™t form the cycle, then include that edge in MST. Otherwise, discard it.
    Step 5: Repeat from step 2 until it includes |V| - 1 edges in MST.
    Expected Output Of the code:-
    Enter the number of vertices: 
    Enter the number of edges:
    Enter the details of each edge (source, destination, weight): 
    Give input for the above line in the following manner
    0 1 7
    where 0 is the soucre of edge 1 is the destination and 7 is the weight of the edge*/
