  ------------------------------------------- The Problem Statement ------------------------------------------------------

    Given a unsorted array of size "n" we have to sort the array using Gnome sort.
    The first line of input is the size of the array going to be given and second line represents the array elements of size "n"

       INPUT :-  4
                  [5,3,4,2]

       OUTPUT :-  [2,3,4,5]

  ----------------------------------------------- Gnome Algorithm --------------------------------------------------------

    Gnome Algorithm will be as insertion sort but not the exact same.

    Firstly sorting an array in ascending order means the elements on the left side of an element should be less than the
    element we choosen.

    Lets take a pointer "pointer" which will be used to iterate the array whose current position is 0

    1) since there is no element on left side we can move to next element by incrementing pointer by 1
       to compare to say whether the array is sorted or not.

          if(pointer==0) { pointer++; }

    2) If the element on the left side is greater than the pointer element we need to swap.

           if(array[pointer] < array[pointer-1]) { swap(array[pointer] < array[pointer-1]); pointer--; }

    3) If the pointer element is equal or greater than the left side element we have to do nothing with the array just
       increment the pointer by 1, so it points to the next element.

            if(array[pointer] >= array[pointer-1]) { pointer++; }

    Since first and third conditions are doing the same job we can combine it as a single if block using "OR" operator to reduce the code redundancy like this,

            if(pointer == 0 or array[pointer] < array[pointer-1]) { pointer++; }

   ----------------------------------------------- Complexities ----------------------------------------------------------

       Time Complexity  :- BigO(n^2)
       Space Complexity :- BigO(1)
       Space Complexity :- BigO(n) --> If you used recursion for sorting.
