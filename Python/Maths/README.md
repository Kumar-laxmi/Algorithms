## Root Finding Methods
### Contents
- Bi Section method


### Details
#### Bi Section
In this method we will assume that the answer is in between the curve inside the intervals.

If curve really touches x-axis inside the interval then on every iteration we will get closer and closer to the root i.e. the point where the equation touches x-axis

This method has a convergence of 1 (i.e. linear convergence)
