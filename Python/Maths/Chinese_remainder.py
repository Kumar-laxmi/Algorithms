    /*The Chinese Remainder Theorem is used to solve modular arithmetic problems efficiently.Modular arithmetic involves performing 
    arithmetic operations on remainders. For example, if we divide 13 by 5, the remainder is 3. In modular arithmetic notation, we 
    would write this as 13 â‰¡ 3 (mod 5), which means that 13 is congruent to 3 modulo 5."""

     num[] produces corresponding remainders in rem[]. Once we find such an x, we return it. """
