# Greedy Algorithm

## 1. [Fractional Knapsack problem](fractional_knapsack.py)

This script solves the fractional knapsack problem using a greedy approach.  
User is prompted to enter:

1. capacity of the knapsack
2. number of items available
3. values of the items
4. weights of the items  

The maximum possible value that can be stored in the knapsack is returned,
along with the chosen items and their fractions.
