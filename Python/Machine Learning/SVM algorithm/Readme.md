#Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm - Python 

##Features

Utilizes the NumPy library for efficient numerical operations.
Simple and concise code using object-oriented programming.
Implements a basic version of the SVM algorithm with a linear kernel.
Supports a limited dataset size due to performance considerations.
Demonstrates the usage of a Python class to encapsulate SVM functionalities.

##Dependencies

Python 3.x
NumPy


##How to Run

Ensure that Python and NumPy are installed on your system.
Open the svm algo.py file.
Modify the dataset generation parameters (e.g., sample size, feature size) as desired.
Run the script.
The program will train the SVM model on a randomly generated dataset and make predictions on a test set.
The predicted labels will be displayed in the console.
