Note: In the pseudocode, 'n' represents the number of vertices in the graph, 'graph' represents the adjacency list representation of the graph, 'residualGraph' represents the residual graph, and 'parent' is an array used to store the parent vertices in the BFS traversal. The 'addEdge' function is used to add edges to the graph and residual graph.
