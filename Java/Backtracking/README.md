## Backtracking 
## Backtracking is a problem-solving technique that involves systematically exploring different possibilities to find a solution. 
It starts by making a choice and progressing step by step. If a chosen path leads to a dead end or fails to meet the desired condition, 
the process goes back to the previous step and tries an alternative option. This iterative approach continues until a valid solution is 
found or all possible options have been exhausted. Backtracking is commonly used in various fields, such as computer algorithms, puzzles, 
and optimization problems.
