// Cpp-program to implement famous Kruskal's Algorithm
// Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that is used to find the minimum spanning tree from a graph.

// The idea is to sort all edges of given graph in increasing order, and then keep on adding new edges and nodes in the spanning tree if the added edge does not form a cycle.


/* A minimum spanning tree is constructed from a weighted & undirected graph, so it:
-> Connects all nodes / vertices
-> Has no cycles
-> Has smallest possible sum of edge weights.*/


// Time Complexity: O(E log N)
