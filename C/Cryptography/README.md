# Cryptography

- Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. 
- The term is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden.
## Principals of Cryptography

- Cryptographic principles are the fundamental concepts and techniques that are used in the field of cryptography to secure communication and protect data. 
- These principles include confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and key management.

## Hill Cipher in C :

- Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.

- Since the early days, ciphers were a common concept when it came to delivering secret messages. 
- Several methods have emerged over the years, in the history of cryptography, that built the foundation for modern algorithms.
- Despite these advancements, Hill Cipher has proven to be a simple and unique way for hiding messages in plain sight.

## Advantages of Hill Cipher 

- It perfectly conceals single-letter frequencies
3Ã—3 Hill Ciphers are extremely effective when it comes to hiding both single-letter and two-letter frequency information.
- It is highly strong against attacks made on ciphertext except if the attack is through a known plaintext.
