/*
------------------------------------- Fleuryâ€™s Algorithm -------------------------------------

Approach:-
1. Start with any vertex in the graph.

2. While there are unused edges in the graph, do the following steps:
    a. Choose any unused edge connected to the current vertex. It doesn't matter which one you choose.
    b. If removing the chosen edge doesn't disconnect the graph, go to the vertex at the other end of the chosen edge.
    c. If removing the chosen edge disconnects the graph, backtrack to the previous vertex that still has unused edges and choose a different edge.
    d. Repeat steps (a) to (c) until you can no longer choose any unused edges from the current vertex.

3. The algorithm terminates when you have traversed all the edges of the graph.

4. If all the vertices in the graph have even degrees, you will end up with an Eulerian circuit, which is a closed path that visits each edge exactly once.

5. If exactly two vertices in the graph have odd degrees, you will end up with an Eulerian path, which is a path that starts and ends at different vertices and visits each edge exactly once.
