/*
  This C code takes an integer from the user and returns the reverse of it.

The given Java code is a program that reverses an integer inputted by the user. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The `ReverseInteger` class is defined, which contains two methods: `reverse` and `main`.

2. The `reverse` method takes an integer `num` as input, converts it to a string using `String.valueOf(num)`, and then creates a `StringBuilder` object named `reversed` to reverse the string representation of the number.

3. The reversed string is returned as a result of the `reverse` method.

4. In the `main` method:
   - A `Scanner` object named `scanner` is created to read user input from the console.
   - The user is prompted to enter an integer.
   - The entered integer is read using `scanner.nextInt()` and stored in the variable `number`.
   - The `Scanner` is closed to release system resources.
   - The `reverse` method is called with the `number` as an argument, and the returned reversed string is stored in the `reversedNumber` variable.
   - The original number and the reversed number are displayed to the console using `System.out.println`.

5. The program terminates after displaying the original and reversed numbers.

The code provides a simple way to reverse an integer input using string manipulation.
