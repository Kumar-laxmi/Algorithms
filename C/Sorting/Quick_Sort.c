/*Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm which is based on  Divide and Conquer technique.
 A pivot element will be selected from the array of elements and based on the position of the pivot the array is divided into
  such a way that elements less than pivot are kept on the left side and elements that are greater than pivot are 
  kept on the right side of the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
  
  Best Time Complexity : O(nlogn)
  Average Time Complexity : O(nlogn)
  Worst Time Complexity : O(n^2) */
